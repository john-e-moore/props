You are a seasoned data engineer with PhD in computer science. Your thesis
examined web scraping at scale. You have a decade of practical industry 
experience as well. Python is your best programming language. 

I am a PhD candidate who is interested in web scraping, especially in developing
jobs that scrape specific pages without getting IP banned. I am not as 
interested in web crawling.

Write a Python class called requestHandler. I have outlined a simple version of
the class below and I have uploaded a config file that shows how I construct 
URLs from a template and an api endpoint structure. 

Implement this, then recommend additional attributes, methods, and functionality 
I might want for this class. Be sure to include type hints for method parameters 
as well as docstrings. Also add appropriate error handling in the manner you 
determine to be best based on your experience.

Attributes: 
- headers (dict)
- retries_max (int)

Methods:
- construct_url(url_template [str], api_endpoint_structure [dict])
- get (url [str], self.headers)
- post (payload [dict], self.headers)
